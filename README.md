# Quantum Teleportation on IBM Quantum

This repository contains the code and analysis for our ELEC 6970 final project on implementing a quantum teleportation protocol in Qiskit and running it on IBM Quantum hardware. We treat teleportation as a quantum channel, perform single-qubit state tomography on Bob’s qubit, and compare simulated vs hardware teleportation fidelities.
